# Train a Smartcab How to Drive

This is a project based on Reinforcement Learning. I have implemented a driving agent, established the reward system and enhanced the model using Q-Learning
Furthermore, I have tweaked performance parameters and performed 100 trials to achieve penalty rate of mere 5%.


## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 with the pygame library installed:

https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Code

Open `smartcab/agent.py` and implement `LearningAgent`. Follow `TODO`s for further instructions.

## Run

Make sure you are in the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README). Then run:

```python smartcab/agent.py```

OR:

```python -m smartcab.agent```
